#
# --- Section 2: [Command Line Arguments] ---
#

# Use the command line argument "cfgFile=/etc/anotherconfig.conf" to
# specify a different config file for fhgfs_storage.
#
# All other options in this file can also be used as command line
# arguments, overriding the corresponding config file values.


#
# --- Section 3.1: [Logging] ---
#

# [logLevel]
# Defines the amount of output messages. The higher this level, the more
# detailed the log messages will be.
# Note: Levels above 3 might decrease performance.
# Default: 3 (Max: 5)

# [logNoDate]
# Defines whether "date & time" (=false) or the current "time only" (=true)
# should be logged.
# Default: false

# [logStdFile]
# The path and filename of the log file for standard log messages. If no name
# is specified, the messages will be written to the console.
# Default: /var/log/fhgfs_storage.log

# [logNumLines]
# The maximum number of lines per log file.
# Default: 50000

# [logNumRotatedFiles]
# The number of old files to keep when "logNumLines" is reached and the log file
# is rewritten (log rotation).
# Default: 5


#
# --- Section 3.2: [Connections & Communication] ---
#

# [connPortShift]
# Shifts all following UDP and TCP ports according to the specified value.
# Intended to make port configuration easier in case you do not want to
# configure each port individually.
# Default: 0

# [connMgmtdPortUDP], [connMgmtdPortTCP]
# The UDP and TCP ports of the management node.
# Default: 8008

# [connStoragePortUDP], [connStoragePortTCP]
# The UDP and TCP ports of the storage node.
# Default: 8003

# [connUseSDP]
# Enables the Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP) for RDMA-ready interconnects.
# SDP performance is somewhere between TCP over IB and native RDMA, so there
# is no need to enable SDP when you have native RDMA enabled.
# Default: false

# [connUseRDMA]
# Enables the use of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) for Infiniband.
# For this setting to be effective, OFED ibverbs support has to be enabled at
# compile time of the fhgfs_opentk library.
# Default: true

# [connBacklogTCP]
# The TCP listen backlog.
# Default: 64

# [connInterfacesFile]
# The path to a text file that specifies the names of the interfaces, which
# may be used for communication. One interface per line. The line number also
# defines the priority of the interface.
# Example: "ib0" in the first line, "eth0" in the second line.
# Values: This setting is optional. If unspecified, all available interfaces
#    will be used and priorities will be assigned automatically.
# Note: This has no influence on outgoing connections. The information is sent
#    to other hosts to inform them about possible communication paths.
# Default: <none>

# [connNetFilterFile]
# The path to a text file that specifies allowed IP subnets, which may be used
# for outgoing communication. One subnet per line in classless notation (IP
# address and number of significant bits).
# Example: "192.168.10.0/24" in the first line, "192.168.20.0/24" in the second
#    line.
# Values: This setting is optional. If unspecified, all addresses are allowed
#    for outgoing communication.
# Default: <none>


#
# --- Section 3.3: [Storage] ---
#

# [storeStorageDirectory]
# The absoute path to a storage target. A storage target is a directory where
# the file system can store raw user file contents. Multiple targets can be
# specified as a comma-separated list.
# Example: /mnt/fhgfs_storage1,/mnt/fhgfs_storage2
# Default: <none>

# [storeAllowFirstRunInit]
# Enables or disables daemon startup with an uninitialized storage directory.
# This can be used to make sure that the daemon does not run when the storage
# partition is not mounted (e.g. because it needs repair after a power outage).
# Note: This setting must be enabled during first startup of the daemon, but
#    may be disabled afterwards.
# Default: true


#
# --- Section 3.4: [Tuning] ---
#

# [tuneNumWorkers]
# The number of worker threads. Should be at least 3. Higher number of workers
# allows the server to handle more client requests in parallel, which also
# results in more concurrent access to the underlying storage device.
# Default: 8

# [tuneWorkerBufSize]
# The buffer size, which is allocated twice by each worker thread for IO and
# network data buffering.
# Note: For optimal performance, this value must be at least 1MB higher than
#    tuneFileReadSize and tuneFileWriteSize.
# Default: 4m

# [tuneFileReadSize], [tuneFileWriteSize]
# The maximum amount of data that the server should write to (or read from)
# the underlying local file system in a single operation.
# Note: Setting these values higher than the file chunk size or
#    tuneWorkerBufSize has no effect.
# Default: tuneFileReadSize=32k, tuneFileWriteSize=64k


#
# --- Section 3.5: [System Settings] ---
#

# [sysMgmtdHost]
# Hostname (or IP) of the host running the management service.
# (See also "connMgmtdPortUDP" and "connMgmtdPortTCP")
# Default: <none>


#
# --- Section 3.6: [Startup] ---
#

# [runDaemonized]
# Detach the process from its parent (and from stdin/-out/-err).
# Default: true
