# This file is sourced by /usr/sbin/fhgfs-opentk-lib-update-ib.
# It is intended to forcefully enable IB RDMA support for the opentk library.
#
# This is useful for systems where a client image is created in a chroot:
# If the server of that chroot does not have IB support or the chroot does not
# have all required file systems mounted, then native IB support would be
# disabled during the fhgfs-opentk-lib package installation.
#
# Setting FORCE_IB=1 here will skip auto-detection and enable IB support.
